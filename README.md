   git clone https://github.com/mdmakky/Facebook-Cleaner.git
   cd Facebook-Cleaner
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" button
   - Select the `facebook-element-hider` folder

3. **Verify installation:**
   - The extension icon should appear in your toolbar
   - Navigate to Facebook to test functionality

### Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)
The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store soon.

## 🎯 Usage

### Automatic Operation
The extension works automatically when you visit Facebook:
- **Default Settings**: People You May Know, Reels, Group Suggestions, and Left Sidebar cleanup are enabled
- **Instant Hiding**: Elements are hidden immediately using CSS while JavaScript detection runs
- **Smart Detection**: Multiple detection methods ensure reliability across Facebook updates

### Settings Control
- Click the Facebook Cleaner icon in your Chrome toolbar to open settings popup
- Toggle individual features on/off:
  - People You May Know
  - Group Suggestions  
  - Reels
  - Friend Requests
  - Birthdays
  - Contacts
  - Left Sidebar Cleanup
  - Top Navigation elements (Watch, Marketplace, Groups, Gaming)
- Changes apply immediately (no page refresh needed)

### Debug Functions
Open the browser console on Facebook and use these debug functions:

```javascript
// Test all hiding functionality
window.testFacebookCleaner();

// Test left sidebar cleanup specifically  
window.testLeftSidebarCleanup();

// Debug current page elements
window.debugFacebookElements();
```

## 🔧 How It Works

The extension uses advanced techniques for reliable Facebook element hiding:

- **Instant CSS Injection**: Critical elements are hidden immediately with CSS while JavaScript loads
- **Multi-Method Detection**: Uses text content, aria-labels, data attributes, and DOM structure
- **Safe DOM Traversal**: Intelligently finds container elements without breaking Facebook functionality  
- **Mutation Observer**: Automatically detects and hides dynamically loaded content
- **Settings Persistence**: Chrome storage API integration with localStorage fallback
- **Performance Optimization**: Throttled execution prevents excessive DOM processing

### Technical Features
- **Position-based Filtering**: Distinguishes between top navigation and sidebar elements
- **Context Awareness**: Prevents hiding important containers like main content areas
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Multiple detection strategies ensure reliability
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection
